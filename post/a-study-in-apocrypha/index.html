                <p>It has been 136 years since the first Holmes story released at the Strand Magazine, and during the following 27 years, Sir Doyle created 4 novellas and 56 short stories, making Sherlock Holmes the most classic imagine on the stage of virtual detectives. But will the raw tales satisfy the fans all over the world? Obviously impossible! And for the love to Sherlock, the new works—Fan fiction or apocrypha in another way, has been created, and the process never ending.<br>
And the topics of these is quiet a lot, I will give out a brief classification introduced. (I divide them into three parts)<br>
The first kind, still remine in the Victorian, and create new stories of Holmes. The typical works are from John Dickson Carr and Mourice Leblanc. Carr, be recognized as one of the greatest detective novel writers, (in his age, he’s as famous as Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen) He created The exploit of Sherlock Holmes, someone says he attach too much features, such the knowledge to the sky, the violin skill and shooting in the room, but that’s what I like, it’s a collection worth reading. Mourice Leblanc, who writes the Arsene Lupin, another classic character, created the first Lupin stories, with Holmes on stage, and that’s a French story, Lupin wins. In the field of movie and series, both BBC and Hollywood created thousands of the stories, I’m impressive with by iron-man-like Holmes. Lol. Another important branch is Holmes V.S. Jack the Ripper. Jack the Ripper is a real character in history, a cruel murderer, haven’t grasp till now. The tales mostly create in 20th century, those who want to solve the problems fancy Holmes solved the case. The most outstanding one, by Shimada Soji, 切り裂きジャックの世紀-古い孤独, with two lines in it, showing his answer. Detective Conan the movie The Undead of Baker Street, anyway they did make it.<br>
The second kind, let the Holmes in the modern age, mostly taken by the TV series maker. BBC series Sherlock, since 2010, a modern, long face Holmes, world famous now, is there a season 5? Elementary by CBS, bring us a female Watson, In the Japanese ones, Miss Sherlock, both female Sherlock and Watson, the most impressive detail, female Sherlock can bouncing and vivacious in high heels. The largest disadvantage, also the advantage, they are basic on the original stories and for those who already known, it’s easy to know who’s the murderer.<br>
The last category, also the most fuzzy kind, both Holmes and Watson don’t show up. Le mystere Sherlock, an funny book, using the place and mock those who addict in the virtual world, really worth a read.<br>
I can tell more about the topic, but for long I only read the Chinese books, the introduction is only a part of my research, if I got the change or U are willing to share your view, it can be better.</p>
